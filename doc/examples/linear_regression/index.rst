Linear Regression
=================

In these notebooks we present some **prerequisites** for using **coax**. We do this by showing how
to implement linear regression in pure JAX as well as in Haiku. The latter is the library on which
the **coax** function approximators are based.

To keep things simple, we'll just do some very basic linear regression to illustrate the basics of
JAX and Haiku.
