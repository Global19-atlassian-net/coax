Next Steps
==========


Well done! At this point you installed **coax** and JAX, you wrote a linear regression model in JAX
and Haiku, and trained your own RL agents.

The best place to continue is to head over to the :doc:`/examples/index` page to have a look at
other agents. For instance, you may be interested in training an agent for continuous action spaces.
In which case, you'll like this example: :doc:`/examples/pendulum/ddpg`.
